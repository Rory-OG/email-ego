# Email Ego Network Tool
This is a project focused on developing an open-source email ego network analysis/visualization tool that can be used with exported email metadata to better understand one's social network inherently present in their email metadata. 


# Data science project structure
This is my template for initiating a data science project. 
The project structure consists of the following: 
1. docs: A folder for storing all domain knowledge, brainstorming, user stories, and information about the architecture of the project. 
2. data: broken into *raw* and *interim* folders, this folder will contain all raw data and intermediate data that must be stored to execute the project
3. script: Where all functions broken into the various steps in a data science pipeline written as functions to be executed by one main file. 
4. output: Where all binary files will be stored for descriptive, exploratory, and reporting purposes.

This project structure is built with the intention of transition a project from research to product.
